## Brief Introduction
The project will explore some aspect mainly in data preprocessing and classifier. We use some different ways to input the missing value, transform the data, resampling, and also the machine learning classifier that was used. Rather than choosing only 2 or some features using PCA, we decided to try to explore some combination of the feature (2 features) and rank the result. The metrics that was mainly important were precision and f1. However, we also take into acount the roc auc (TPR vs FPR) of the model.

## Higlighted Result
The best result in term of precision, f1, and auc is
